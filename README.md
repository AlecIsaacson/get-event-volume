# get-event-volume
This app uses New Relic's GraphQL API to generate a list of all event types found in your New Relic account.  For each event type found, it then queries for the volume of data sent, showing the results in bytes.

It's the equivalent to doing this in NRQL:

  `show event types`

Then for each event type:

  `FROM (eventType) SELECT bytecountestimate()`
  
The output is formatted *eventType, bytesCollected* with one event type per line
  
We output to the console, so you'll need to redirect to a file if you want to view this info in an editor or spreadsheet.

The utility takes the following command line arguments:

`-apikey : [REQUIRED] A user API key that is good for the account you want to pull data from.`  
`-accountId : [REQUIRED] The ID of the account you want to pull data from.`  
`-since : The number of hours prior to now that we query data for.  The default is 1 hour.`  
`-filter : The name of a file that contains event types to be excluded from this query.  This is an optional switch.`  
`-verbose : Increases the verbosity of the app's output for troubleshooting purposes.  This is an optional switch.`

The filter file should be a simple list of event types to exclude, one per line.  The example file (nrStockEvents.txt) lists most of the stock NR event types as of the date of publication, so if you use it, you'll only see the data consumed by your custom event types.

As an example, this will pull the number of bytes consumed by every event type in an account since 1 hour ago:

`./get-event-volume -apikey *yourAPIKey* -accountId *yourAccountID`

This example will pull the number of bytes consumed by every event type in an account since 12 hours ago, except for the events specified in the filter file.

`./get-event-volume -apikey *yourAPIKey* -accountId *yourAccountID -since 12 -filter skipEvents.txt`
